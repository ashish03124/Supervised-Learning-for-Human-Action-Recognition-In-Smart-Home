# Supervised Learning for Human Activity Recognition in Smart Homes

This project focuses on using supervised learning algorithms to detect and classify human activities within a smart home environment using sensor data. The aim is to make homes intelligent, responsive, energy-efficient, and safe by understanding occupant behavior.

---

## Objective

To develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes various human activities (e.g., sleeping, cooking, watching TV) using labeled sensor data, enabling context-aware smart home automation and monitoring.

## Why Human Activity Recognition?

- Energy Efficiency – Turn off unused appliances based on activity
- Elderly Care – Detect unusual inactivity, falls, or health anomalies
- Safety – Automated alerts for emergencies
- Automation – Context-aware control of lights, temperature, entertainment
- Personalization – Tailored services based on user routines

---

## Why Supervised Learning?

- Trains on labeled datasets: `[Sensor Input] → [Activity Label]`
- High accuracy in classification tasks
- Models can be updated over time with new data
- Algorithms like KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks work well

---

## Sample Activities

- Sleeping
- Cooking
- Eating
- Watching TV
- Bathroom usage
- Walking inside home
- Working on computer

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (with scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch)
- Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
- IoT sensor datasets – e.g., Motion, Pressure, Temperature

---

## Workflow

1. Data Collection – Load labeled smart home sensor dataset
2. Preprocessing – Clean, normalize, and transform data
3. Model Training – Apply and evaluate supervised ML algorithms
4. Prediction – Test model with unseen sensor data
5. Automation – Trigger smart home actions based on predictions

## Example Dataset

| Motion Sensor | Pressure Sensor | Temperature | Time of Day | Activity     |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1             | 0                | 22.4        | Morning      | Cooking      |
| 0             | 1                | 20.1        | Night        | Sleeping     |
| 1             | 1                | 23.0        | Evening      | Watching TV  |

## Future Scope

- Add deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series activity tracking)
- Real-time prediction and automation
- Extend for multi-person environments
- Integrate with IoT devices for full automation
